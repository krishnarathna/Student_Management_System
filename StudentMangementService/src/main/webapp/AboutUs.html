		<p>The University of Cambridge is a public collegiate research
			university in Cambridge, England. Founded in 1209, the University of
			Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous
			operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars
			who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with
			local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities,
			although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features
			and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge. The school is often
			ranked as one of the most prestigous universities in the world. In
			1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with
			a royal charter, granted by King Henry III. The University of
			Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over
			150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised
			into six schools. The largest department is Cambridge University
			Press & Assessment, which has ï¿½1 billion of annual revenue and
			reaches 100 million learners.[12] All of the colleges are
			self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own
			personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a
			college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at
			Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the
			colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally
			further supervision provided by the central university faculties and
			departments.[13][14] The university operates eight cultural and
			scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge
			University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of
			approximately 16 million books, around nine million of which are in
			Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the
			world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and
			affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes.[15] Among the university's
			notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes[16] and several
			historically iconic and transformational individuals in their
			respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver
			Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John
			Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Sylvia
			Plath, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and
			others.</p>

		<p>The university occupies a central location within the city of
			Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately
			20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021,
			resulting in a lower age demographic in the city.[53] Most of the
			university's older colleges are located near the city centre, through
			which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the
			River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings that
			surround the river.[54] A few of the notable University of Cambridge
			buildings are King's College Chapel;[55] the history faculty
			building[56] designed by James Stirling; and the Cripps Building at
			St John's College.[57] The brickwork of several colleges is notable:
			Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in
			England[58] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of
			English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[59]</p>

		<p>Prior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209,
			Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a
			scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the
			intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the
			nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of
			Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the
			University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an
			administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman,
			were hanged by town authorities without first consulting
			ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to
			pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town
			authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence
			from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving
			Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and
			Cambridge. Enough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to
			form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the
			new university's formation.[17][18][19] By 1225, a chancellor of the
			university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231
			established that rents in Cambridge were to be set secundum
			consuetudinem universitatis, according to the custom of the
			university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen
			to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to
			the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university
			ius non trahi extra, or the right not to be drawn out, for three
			years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside
			of the diocese of Ely.[20] After Cambridge was described as a studium
			generale in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in
